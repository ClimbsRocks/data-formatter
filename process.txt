1. write the test
    create an anonymous function
    that will itself spin up our main python controller process
      our python controller process is giong to import all the other python modules
        invoke them in their proper order, and with their proper arguments
        and generally control things
        it will check, in between each stage, whether we have passed in test or not
          if so, it will send a message back to the parent with the results from the previous operation
          and our parent process will be listening for that result
          then kill the python process
doing it this will will allow us to use multiple cores, since if we have 8 tests, we will be spinning up 8 child_processes, each running independently until they get to the point in the python controller flow that they are testing for. 

      challenge: passing in the arguments?
      that child process will do the concatting
      that child process will check to see if we are in a testing environment
        if test, the child will send back a message with it's script's name and the value it is returning
    the parent function will be listening for a message of exactly that type
      and will return the parsed results
